1️⃣ **What is a Marker Interface?**  
   - A marker interface is an empty interface (without methods or fields) used to mark a class so that Java runtime or frameworks can apply special behavior.  
   
2️⃣ **What does "mark" mean in a Marker Interface?**  
   - "Marking" means labeling a class with an interface so that Java or a framework recognizes it and applies specific behavior (e.g., `Serializable` allows serialization).  

3️⃣ **Why use a Marker Interface?**  
   - Enables special behavior at runtime (e.g., `Serializable`, `Cloneable`).  
   - Provides type safety.  
   - Used in frameworks like Spring.  
   - Allows custom implementation for specific logic.  

4️⃣ **What are the different types of repositories in Spring Data?**  
   - `Repository<T, ID>` → Core marker interface.  
   - `CrudRepository<T, ID>` → Basic CRUD operations.  
   - `JpaRepository<T, ID>` → Advanced JPA methods and batch processing.  
   - `PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID>` → Pagination and sorting.  
   - `ReactiveCrudRepository<T, ID>` → Non-blocking (WebFlux).
